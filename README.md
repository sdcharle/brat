BRAT is Bloominglabs' RFID Access Tracker. It owes Miguel Grinberg bigtime. Check out his Flask Mega-Tutorial series that begins [here](http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

Installation
------------

Info to follow. You need the right modules and shizzola

Running
-------

To run the application in the development web server just execute `run.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.

Better yet set it up under say lighttpd and fast-cgi
