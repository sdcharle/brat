[4;31mWarning[0m: Some directories in /usr/local/share/man aren't writable.
This can happen if you "sudo make install" software that isn't managed
by Homebrew. If a brew tries to add locale information to one of these
directories, then the install will fail during the link step.
You should probably `chown` them:

    /usr/local/share/man/mann
[4;31mWarning[0m: "config" scripts exist outside your system or Homebrew directories.
`./configure` scripts often look for *-config scripts to determine if
software packages are installed, and what additional flags to use when
compiling and linking.

Having additional scripts in your path can confuse software installed via
Homebrew if the config script overrides a system or Homebrew provided
script of the same name. We found the following "config" scripts:

[4;31mWarning[0m: gettext files detected at a system prefix
These files can cause compilation and link failures, especially if they
are compiled with improper architectures. Consider removing these files:
    /usr/local/lib/libgettextlib.dylib
    /usr/local/lib/libintl.dylib
[4;31mWarning[0m: libiconv files detected at a system prefix other than /usr
Homebrew doesn't provide a libiconv formula, and expects to link against
the system version in /usr. libiconv in other prefixes can cause
compile or link failure, especially if compiled with improper
architectures. OS X itself never installs anything to /usr/local so
it was either installed by a user or some other third party software.

tl;dr: delete these files:
    /usr/local/lib/libiconv.dylib
